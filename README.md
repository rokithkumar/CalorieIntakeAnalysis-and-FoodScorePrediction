# NutriScore
Welcome to NutriScore - a application that uses Tableau to analyze the nutritional value of various foods and meal types, calculates personalized calorie requirements for individuals based on their health profile using the BMR formula, and predicts a food score using machine learning models.

With NutriScore, individuals can make informed decisions about their food choices based on their nutritional needs and health goals. Our application uses a combination of Tableau, Python, and machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.

Our application provides a user-friendly interface for individuals to input their health profile and receive personalized food recommendations. The application also allows individuals to track their food intake and monitor their progress towards their health goals.

The NutriScore GitHub repository includes all the necessary resources to run the application, including the code, data sources, documentation, and installation instructions. Additionally, we provide detailed explanations of our methodology, including the machine learning algorithms used, and any other relevant information.

We invite you to explore the NutriScore application and join us in our mission to help individuals achieve their health goals through personalized nutrition recommendations.
